## ü™ê Customization

To customize the script to your liking, you can modify several variables and functions:

- **Text Editor**: Change the `NEOVIM` variable to the path of your preferred text editor.

- Implement real-time file synchronization.
- Add more file operations like emailing, sharing, etc.
